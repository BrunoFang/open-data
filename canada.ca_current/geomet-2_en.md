# Geospatial web services

MSC GeoMet provides access to the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) open data, including raw numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data layers, the weather radar composite and hydrometric data, via Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards such as the [Web Map Service (WMS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms). Meteorological and hydrological layers are served dynamically through the Web Map Service (WMS) standard to enable end-users to display meteorological data within their own tools, on interactive web maps and in mobile apps.


## Targeted Users

This service is intended for specialized users and developers with knowledge of meteorological and geospatial information technology. Users may visualize or process weather data with common geospatial tools; integrate meteorological layers with other data into their own platforms, or; display meteorological layers on interactive web maps on the web or on mobile devices.


## How to use the service

### Web Map Service and Web Coverage Service

MSC GeoMet serves meteorological, environmental and hydrometric layers at multiple time steps in the [Web Map Service (WMS) standard](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) and  [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) standards.

WCS: https://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet?service=WCS&version=2.0.1request=GetCapabilities<br>

### Changes to the MSC GeoMet Services

The MSC needs to be flexible in the manner in which it offers specialized data to interested users. Therefore, we need to be able to update or change formats or data offerings in a timely manner, as the technology and standards do change continuously. The MSC does not guarantee using any specific formats for any prolonged period of time. We are under no obligation to notify the users in advance of any changes, but we will make every effort, when possible, to inform users subscribed to our mailing list. With that information available, it will be the responsibility of users to ensure they can adapt to upcoming changes in formats, times of issuance, types of data, etc. In order to subscribe to our GeoMet-Information mailing list, please go to: [GeoMet-Info Mailing List](https://lists.ec.gc.ca/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/geomet-info).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I use this data?

MSC GeoMet weather layers may be accessed through the Web Map Service (WMS) standard.

* The layers available in the WMS standard can be used to build interactive web maps and mobile apps with tools like OpenLayers and Leaflet.
* The layers available in the WMS standard can be accessed with a variety of software going from proprietary programs such as Esri's ArcGIS to open source solutions like QGIS.

It is anticipated that MSC GeoMet weather layers will reach consumers through the development of applications by third parties.

### What are the benefits of using the MSC GeoMet web services?
