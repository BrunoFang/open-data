# Weather tools: specialized data

In addition to providing Canadians with up-to-date information on past, present and future weather conditions, climate trends and the quantity of water in lakes and rivers across the country, Environment and Climate Change Canada offers a service aimed at more specialized users.

These clients often use the more detailed weather information as part of their decision-making processes for businesses, and require the information regularly in its unprocessed form. That is why Environment and Climate Change Canada offers a selection of data that these users can freely access, and also provides limited services for the delivery or customization of specific information.

The products offered to clients include:

* [Free weather data service](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/free-service.html)
* [Geospatial web services](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/geospatial-web-services.html)
* [Fee-based weather data service](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-general-tools-resources/weather-tools-specialized-data/fee-based-service.html)

For more details on these types of services, a data services outline is available.
