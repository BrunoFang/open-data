# Free weather data service

Apart from the traditional text-based [observations](http://weather.gc.ca/provincialsummary_table/pages/pe_obs_metric_e.html) and [forecasts](http://weather.gc.ca/forecast/public_bulletins_e.html), meteorological information in other formats can be very useful to individuals and weather sensitive businesses for use in their planning and decision-making. That’s why Environment Canada’s Meteorological Service has a vast offering of data available via the internet, where users can download what they need.

Through this http service, users can find a variety of data such as:

* Three, hourly numerical weather model outputs for North America or the world offered in a gridded binary (GRIB) format;
* Probability forecasts derived using a technique called “ensemble forecasting;”
* Observed and forecast vertical temperature profiles; 
* Official forecasts with hourly values in different formats (XML, CSV);
* A variety of radar images, including precipitation accumulations;
* Hourly Canadian site observations in XML format;
* Tables derived from weather models containing weather elements like temperature, wind, cloud cover, precipitation amounts, etc.;
* Varied national and international weather bulletins in text format;
* Air quality data; and
* Wave model data.

New data, information and formats are added as they become available.
