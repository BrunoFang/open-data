Examples of available data include:

* Computer model data in a GRIdded Binary (GRIB) format for specific parameters and domains (down to hourly values), or point specific;
* Unprocessed radar data for Canadian radars, as:
  * Digital Outputs - of radar echoes or precipitation (in ASCII format)
  * Full Doppler volume scans data (in IRIS format);
* Meteorological maps;
* Text form bulletins; and
* Most of the data available on the free http server.

The internet SFTP push delivery is available on a monthly basis for a fee, and includes 24/7 support. CMC also offers a de-archiving service for past model data.
