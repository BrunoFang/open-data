# Data of the alphanumerical bulletins 

This page describes the data of the [marine weather](readme_marineweather_en.md).

The XML files are updated 2-4 times daily at a minimum, but can be updated
"as needed" with issuance of forecast amendments, marine weather alerts
(warnings and watches) and Ice alert information.

Environment and Climate Change Canada's guide to the marine forecast includes information on the issuing time of forecasts, time period
covered by forecast, determination of forecast regions, forecast time
period terminology, information included in the forecast, and forecast
revision.
