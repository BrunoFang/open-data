# Data and products of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System

The Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) performs physical calculations to produce deterministic forecasts of elements of the atmosphere from the present day to 48 hours in the future. Elements of the atmosphere include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and humidity. This product contains the raw numerical results of these calculations. Geographic coverage includes Canada and the United States. The horizontal spatial resolution of the data is 10 km. Data is available for 80 vertical levels. Forecasts are performed four times a day.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively:

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_rdps-datamart_en.md) 
* Link to the subpage of the dataset for GeoMet [example](../../msc-geomet/giops_en.md), if the subpage exists 
  * NOTE: does not exist for the RDPS
  
An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage-overview/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [End-User Licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's Data Servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.
