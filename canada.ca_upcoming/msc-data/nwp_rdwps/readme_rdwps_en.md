# Data and Products of the Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS)

The Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS) produces wave forecasts using the third generation spectral wave model WaveWatch III®. The model is forced by the 10 meters winds from the High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS). An ice forecast from the Water Cycle Prediction System of the Great Lakes (WCPS-GLS) is used by the model to dampen or suppress wave growth in areas covered respectively with 25% to 75% and more than 75% ice. 
The WW3 (Tolman and the WAVEWATCH III® Development Group 2014) is a third generation spectral wave prediction model that solves the evolution of the energy balance equation for the 2-D wave energy spectrum without any prior assumptions on the shape of the spectrum. The WW3 model has been implemented by a growing number of national operational forecasting centres over the last several years. 

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively:

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_rdwps-datamart_en.md) 
* Link to the subpage of the dataset for GeoMet [example](../../msc-geomet/giops_en.md), if the subpage exists 
	* NOTE: does not exist for the GDPS

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.
