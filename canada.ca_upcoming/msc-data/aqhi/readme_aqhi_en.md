# Data and Products of the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) observation and forecast

The Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) performs physical calculations to produce deterministic forecasts of atmospheric elements from the present day to 10 days in the future. Elements of the atmosphere include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and humidity. This product contains the raw numerical results of these calculations. The geographical coverage is global. The horizontal spatial resolution of the data is 25 and 66 km. Data is available for 28 vertical levels. The forecasts are carried out twice a day.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively:
