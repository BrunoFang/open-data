# Data and products for radar observations

This page describes the data and products of the canadian radars of the Environment and Climate Change Canada's network containing 31 sites concentrated in the most populated parts of Canada, providing radar coverage to more than 95 per cent of Canadians. The network’s primary purpose is the early detection of developing thunderstorms and high impact weather, as well the tracking of precipitation.
