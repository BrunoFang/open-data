# Data and Products of the Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS)

The Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at probabilistic predictions of atmospheric elements from the beginning of a month out to up to 12 months into the future. Atmospheric elements include temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction and others. This product contains raw numerical results of these calculations. Geographical coverage is global. Data is available on a grid at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 degrees and for a few selected vertical levels. Predictions and corresponding hindcast are made available monthly.

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively:

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_cansips-datamart_en.md) 
* Link to the subpage of the dataset for GeoMet [example](../../msc-geomet/giops_en.md), if the subpage exists 
	* NOTE: does not exist for the GDPS

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../how-to/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [End-User Licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's Data Servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.

### Metadata
