# Cost-recovered data services

The Meteorological Service of Canada offers the following two cost-recovered data services. Anyone interested in those services is invited to [contact us](http://www.weather.gc.ca/mainmenu/contact_us_e.html).


## Archived data retrieval

Environment and Climate Change Canada does not have on online service to retrieve archived data. The data retrieval service is provided under a cost recovery policy.

The processing rate for archived data retrieval is 99$/hour, with a minimum charge of one hour. Typical archived data retrieval requests require between 2-4 hours to process. The data itself is free.

## Dedicated data feed

Dedicated data feeds with 24/7 support are available to specialized users and may include data not directly available to the public. Pricing varies according to the desired data types and associated bandwidth requirements. Contracts typically span over a year or more, and payments are processed on a monthly basis.

Available data include:
* Numerical Weather Prediction model data in a GRIdded Binary (GRIB2) format for specific parameters and domains (down to hourly values), or specific points
* Unprocessed radar data for Canadian radars, as:
  * Digital Outputs - of radar echoes or precipitation (in ASCII format)
  * Full Doppler volume scans data (in IRIS format)
* Meteorological maps
* Text form bulletins
* Most of the data available on the free [MSC Datamart](../msc-datamart) http server
