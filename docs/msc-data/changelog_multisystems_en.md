# Changes to the Operational Services of the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC)

## Wednesday September 6, 2017

### New High Performance Computing Infrastructure

A major project to migrate to a new supercomputing infrastructure employed by the Meteorological Service of Canada was successfully completed on September 6, 2017. This migration was the result of a joint, sustained effort over several months by experts at the Canadian Meteorological Centre, Science and Technology Directorate, and Shared Services Canada.

Our high-performance computing capacity has now attained the petaflop scale (1015 flops), a level which is comparable to that of the other leading meteorological centres around the world. Over the coming years, this major upgrade will allow further technological transfers from Research and Development into Operations, supporting the continuous improvement of the meteorological and environmental forecast services offered to Canadians and to other federal and provincial government agencies, users, and partners.

The official note announcing the migration is available at [this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2017/08/31/NOCN03_CWAO_312003___11256).
