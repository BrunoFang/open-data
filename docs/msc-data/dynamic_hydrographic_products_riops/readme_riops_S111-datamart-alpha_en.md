# S-111 Dynamic Hydrographic Products(DHP) in HDF5 format using RIOPS(Regional Ice Ocean Prediction System) surface currents data. 

The S-111 Dynamic Hydrographic Products(DHP) for oceanographic models currents is in an open standard HDF5 format with a specification provided by the International Hydrographic Organisation(IHO). Each S-111 data file is a 1x1 degrees regular bounding box tiled subset of RIOPS surface currents data. The S-111 tiled files are using the EPSG:4326 as its GIS Common Reference System(CRS) to define all geographical coordinates locations.
