# Data and Products of the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System 

The Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) carries out physics and chemistry calculations to arrive at deterministic predictions of chemical species concentration of interest to air quality. Chemical constituents include 03, SO2, NO, and NO2 gases as well as fine particulate matter PM2.5 (2.5 micrometers in diameter or less) and coarse particulate matter PM10 (10 micrometers in diameter or less). Predictions are available from the current day out to 48 hours into the future. Geographical coverage is Canada and the United States. Data is available at a horizontal resolution of 10 km. While the system encompasses 80 vertical levels, data is available only for the surface level. Predictions are performed twice a day. 

## Access

### How to access the data

These data are available on the data server services [MSC Datamart](../../msc-datamart/readme_en.md) and the web services [MSC GeoMet](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md) respectively :

* [GRIB2 data available on the MSC Datamart](readme_raqdps-datamart_en.md) 
* [Data available via geospatial web services GeoMet-Weather](../../msc-geomet/readme_en.md)

An [overview and examples to access and use the Meteorological Service of Canada's open data](../../usage/readme_en.md) is available.

### Licence

The [end-user licence for Environment and Climate Change Canada's data servers](../../licence/readme_en.md) specifies the conditions of use of these data.

## Products

* [Maps of 48 hours forecasts for tropospheric ozone near the surface and at altitudes of 50 metres and 500 metres, and for PM 2.5 and PM10 near the surface. Forecasts for PM2.5, PM10, and ozone near the surface and for ozone at 500 metres can be viewed simultaneously on the 4-panel maps.](https://weather.gc.ca/aqfm/index_e.html)
