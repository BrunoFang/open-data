## Tuesday July 3rd 2013

### Update to the RDPS binary (in support of the production of the variable PX)


## Wednesday February 13, 2013

### Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) version 3.1.0 installed at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday February 13 2013, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 3.1.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) in order to harmonize it with the [implementation on that same day of the GDPS-3.0.0](../nwp_gdps/changelog_gdps_en.md). As a result, RDPS forecasts are improved as a result.

Please consult the documentation available regarding the GDPS-3.0.0 implementation [at this link for more information](../nwp_gdps/changelog_gdps_en.md).


## Wednesday October 19 2012

### Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) Data Assimilation Window extended by 5 minutes

Starting with the 18Z run of October 19 2012, the [00,06,12,18]Z runs of the RDPS will now be launched at [00,06,12,18]Z+2:00 allowing those runs to collect an additional 5 minutes of observation data prior to the model integration.


## Wednesday October 3 2012

### Major Upgrade to the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday October 3 2012, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement version 3.0.0 of the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS). This version includes an increase in resolution to 10 km from the previous 15 km, a 4D-Var data assimilation system replacing the previous 3D-Var, as well as important changes in the GEM model physics. This results in significant forecast improvements especially for the winter season.

As part of this implementation the cutoff time for collecting observations has been reduced by 10 minutes and is now [00,06,12,18]Z+1:55

Objective scores show improvements in the forecasts with most metrics throughout most of the atmosphere, in particular for the lower portion of the atmosphere and at the surface. A subjective evaluation by operational meteorologists confirmed those improvements. Other forecast systems which depend on RDPS ouput include similar changes and as a result they also benefit from this version of the RDPS.
