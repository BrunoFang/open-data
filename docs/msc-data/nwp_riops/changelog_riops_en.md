### Implementation of Version 2.0.0 of the Regional Ice and Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday July 3rd, 2019, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will implement the Regional Ice and Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) to version 2.0.0. With this upgrade RIOPS will also switch status from an experimental to an operational system.

The major changes in this implementation are summarized as follows:

* Addition of an independent oceanic data assimilation component which replaces a spectral nudging technique.
* Extension of the domain to the North Pacific.

A copy of the official note announcing the implementation of these changes is available at [this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2019/06/28/NOCN03_CWAO_281850___63233).
