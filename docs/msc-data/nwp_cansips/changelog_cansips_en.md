# Chronology of changes to the Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS)

## Wednesday July 3, 2019

### Upgrade to Version 2 of the Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Wednesday July 3rd, 2019, the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System (CanSIPS) to version 2.
The major changes of CanSIPS in this upgrade are in the forecast component:

* The CANCM3 global coupled model is replaced by newer and better performing GEM-NEMO couped model.
* The CANCM4 model is upgraded with improved sea-ice initialisation.


A technical note with more details on this change [is available at this link](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/docs/tech_notes/technote_cansips-v2_20190703_e.pdf).

### The Canadian Meteorological Centre starts using CanSIPS: Canadian Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction System

On Thursday December 1 2011, CMC started issuing forecasts using its CanSIPS system, a newly developed global coupled seasonal prediction system for forecasting monthly to multi-seasonal climate conditions.

With CanSIPS, Environment Canada will be able to issue seasonal climate condition predictions for lead times out to one full year thanks to a seamless physically-based prediction system; this represents substantive progress with respect to the previous system. CanSIPS can also skillfully predict the ENSO phenomenon (El Niño-La Niña/Southern Oscillation) and its influence on the climate up to a year in advance.

The development and the implementation of this multi-seasonal forecast system is the result of a close collaboration between CMC and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma).

By using CanSIPS operationally, Environment Canada maintains its position amongst leading international organizations producing such long-range predictions. MSC is also contributing to the multi-model ensemble forecasts produced by WMO and the APEC Climate Centre.

Initially no additional products will appear on MSC's monthly and seasonal forecast page (see link below) but the accuracy of existing products are now improved by using CanSIPS. Products from CanSIPS will be available on the first day of every month at this web site. New products will be introduced as part of the upcoming phase 2 of this project.

A copy of the official note announcing the start of the operational use of CanSIPS [is available by clicking here](http://dd.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/doc/genots/2011/11/28/NOCN03_CWAO_281935___35418).
