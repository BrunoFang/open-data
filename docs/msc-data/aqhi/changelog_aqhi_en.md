# Chronology of changes to the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) observation and forecast program

## Tuesday March 11th, 2008

### Improvements to the AQHI forecast program

On Tuesday March 11, 2008 several improvements were made to the processing system that supports the national Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) pilot project.

* The processing of observations was moved forward 10 minutes from 50 mins past the hour to 40 mins past the hour in order to improve the timeliness of the delivery of AQHI observations to the public.

* In preparation for the distribution of SCRIBE v3.10 (the first version of SCRIBE to include an air quality component) to the regions, model output from the operational air quality forecast model CHRONOS was added to the SCRIBE matrices.

* Code was put in place for the addition of the city of Montreal as an official pilot forecast site. However, public dissemination of the product for Montreal has not yet begun.

### Extension of the National AQHI Pilot Project

On Thursday November 22, 2007 the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) Pilot project was officially extended to 14 communities in British Columbia. These communities include 4 sites in the Metro Vancouver region, Central Fraser Valley, Eastern Fraser Valley, South, Central, and North Okanagan, Kamloops, Prince George, Quesnel, Nanaimo/Parksville and Victoria/Saanich.

The national AQHI Pilot project was officially launched July 9, 2007 as a joint effort involving Environment Canada, Health Canada, as well as various regional, municipal, and local health authorities. The 14 new sites join the city of Toronto which was the first community to participate in the program. More communities will join the program in the coming months.

The AQHI is the first health-based index that combines the quality of air with known health effects. The AQHI takes into account how the level of exposure to multiple pollutants, even at low levels of exposure, can affect your health. Observations of AQHI for a particular community are available every hour, with 2-day forecasts being issued twice daily.
