# Chronology of changes to the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS)

## Tuesday November 30, 2021

### Upgrade to Version 2.0.0 of the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS) at the Canadian Meteorological Centre

On Tuesday November 30, 2021, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) will upgrade the Coastal Ice and Ocean Prediction System (CIOPS) East and West to version 2.0.0. Starting with this upgrade, experimental CIOPS East and CIOPS West will obtain operationnal status.

The major changes of CIOPS-East in this upgrade can be summarized as follow:

* Operationnal status
* Reduced bottom roughness
* Increased vertical resolution in the upper water column (75 to 100 levels)
* Reduced wave roughness parameter.
* New wave roughness formulation for wind stress 
* Increased diffusivity in upper St. Lawrence estuary (west of Tadoussac) (drag in estuary)

The major change of CIOPS-West in this upgrade is the addition of a subdomain over Salish Sea area at 500m resolution.
