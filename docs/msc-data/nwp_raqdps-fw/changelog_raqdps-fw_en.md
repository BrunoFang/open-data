# Chronology of changes to the FireWork Prediction System

## Tuesday January 21, 2020

### Upgrade FireWork version adapted to the New High Performance Computing Infrastructure.

See details [at this link](../changelog_multisystems_en.md)

## Monday April 15, 2019

## Installation of the FireWork Prediction System for the Summer Wildfire Season of 2019

On Monday April 15, 2019, starting with the 00 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will reactivate the FireWork prediction system for the summer period of 2019. FireWork is a seasonal modelling system based on the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) which incorporates additional emissions from wildfire events over North America.

For further information, please consult the official note announcing the implementation of FireWork for Summer 2019 [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2019/04/15/NOCN03_CWAO_151930___14392).

## Wednesday September 7, 2016

### Major Upgrade to the FireWork Prediction System

On Wednesday, September 7th, 2016, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will upgrade the FireWork prediction system. FireWork is a seasonal modelling system based on the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) which incorporates near-real-time biomass burning emissions over North America. It executes during the wildfire season which normally ends towards the end of October.

The changes included in this upgrade are equivalent to those described above for [RAQDPS016](/../nwp_raqdps/changelog_raqdps_en.md).

For further information, please consult the official note announcing the implementation of these changes available [at this link](https://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2016/09/02/NOCN03_CWAO_022112___00754).

## Thursday April 14th, 2016

### Installation of the FireWork Prediction System for the Summer Season of 2016

On Thursday April 14th, 2016, starting with the 1200 UTC run, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) will begin execution of the FireWork prediction system for the summer period of 2016. FireWork is a seasonal modelling system based on the Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) which incorporates additional emissions from wildfire events over North America.
