# MSC Datamart redirections
 
## Description

The objective is to put in place URI redirects of the [308 Permanent Redirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection) type for all previous MSC Datamart READMEs which will now be found in the new documentation. This will ensure no existing links will break for users.
 
Redirects must handle redirecting http and https links to the new https target.

## List of redirects
 
Example:
