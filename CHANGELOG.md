# MSC Open Data documentation changelog

This is the user-oriented changelog for the MSC Open Data documentation. It tracks what has changed between the versions published on https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/ . It is used to create the public announcements to [dd_info](https://lists.ec.gc.ca/mailman/listinfo/dd_info) and [GeoMet-Info](https://lists.ec.gc.ca/mailman/listinfo/GeoMet-Info) lists. For GeoMet-Info, the [announcements are stored on the CMC wiki](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/GeoMet/Announcements#Previous_GeoMet-Info_announcements).

# Version naming

MSC's public documentation uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for identifying version numbers. This is version naming scheme [recommended by GoC TBS](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/modern-emerging-technologies/government-canada-standards-apis.html).
