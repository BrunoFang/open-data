## What data can I find on the MSC Datamart?

A lot of our data is accessible through our open data server named the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) Datamart. You will find a short description of all available products, as well as a link to a more detailed documentation for each of them, in this README:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/about_dd_apropos.txt

The terms and conditions of use of Meteorological Data from Environment and Climate Change Canada can be found here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/LICENCE_GENERAL.txt

We also offer geospatial web services named MSC GeoMet. The documentation is available here:

http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C0D9B3D8-1c

Another source of product description can be found on the CMC Product Guide publicly available on our Collaboration web site:

http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmoi/product_guide/table_of_contents_e.html

If you need more information about our services or products, do not hesitate to contact us, using the e-mail address: ec.dps-client.ec@canada.ca

## Do you provide an API through which we can access weather data for a given area and time? 

Environment and Climate Change Canada offers an API to access Canadian weather data via geospatial web services named MSC GeoMet, through the recognized WMS international standard. 
The documentation is available here: 

http://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C0D9B3D8-1c

Data available through WMS can easily be integrated into iOS applications and we're aware of several clients successfully doing so.

For your information, more than 400 layers are available in the WMS GetCapabilities:

http://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet/?lang=F&service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities

We are also in the process of making a lot more of our weather data available in the OGC family of standards (e.g. WMS, WCS, WFS, SLD). 
See the announcement of the GeoMet-Beta version: 

http://lists.ec.gc.ca/pipermail/geomet-info/2016-June/000033.html

Changes to the GeoMet-Beta Geospatial Web Services will be announced on the GeoMet-Info list: 

http://lists.ec.gc.ca/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/geomet-info

Finally, please note that because GeoMet is leveraging open standards, users are not affected when the underlying data is modified: methods to access the data remain stable and reliable. 
GeoMet serves well over 1 million requests daily and is free to use as long as the source is attributed. See the licence below for details: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/LICENCE_GENERAL.txt 

## How can I download data?

The Meteorological Service of Canada has set up a data wire for announcing file availability on the Datamart.  This data wire uses the 'Advanced Message Queuing Protocol' (AMQP), an open
protocol with free librairies in numerous programming languages. This enables the user not only to be notified of available products as they're published, but also to receive them automatically if
he so chooses.
The service may be configured by the user to apply to a specific set of files (weather warnings, observations, model data, etc.) and thus may concern only those products of interest to the user.

The documentation about this service can be found here:

http://dd.weather.gc.ca/doc/README_AMQP.txt

Please, note that while the original documentation mentions the script "dd_subscribe" which runs with both Python2 and Python3, we will be migrating 
to "sr_subscribe" which runs only with Python3. Some documentation is available here:

http://metpx.sourceforge.net/sr_subscribe.1.html

http://metpx.sourceforge.net/Install.html

## Can I have radar data?

The weather radar data we freely provide to the public are the GIF images on the MSC Open data server. You will find the documentation about this service here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/radar/doc/README_radar.txt 

We also provide the North-American weather radar mosaic as WMS geospatial web services:

http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=C0D9B3D8-1 

The license terms for these products can be read here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/LICENCE_GENERAL.txt 

Neither of the above cases includes raw radar data. This and other radar data products are provided as a cost-recovered service. 
As part of this service, we push data to your FTP server and provide 24/7 support. The terms under which these products are provided are similar to those described in the license above.

Documentation about radar formats can be found at the following location:

http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/produits/samples/radar/vscan/Formats_in_URP.pdf 

Documentation about radar products can be found at the following location:

http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/produits/samples/radar/vscan/Radar_Products_Available_CMC_Mai_2015_external.pdf

For data feeds, available formats are as follows:

    - NUMERICA (ASCII)
    - GIF format (recent GIFs available for free on the MSC Datamart)
    - IRIS (raw) format
        Specifications: http://www.vaisala.com/en/hydrology/offering/weatherradars/Pages/IRIS.aspx

    - 1 hour of volume scan for 1 radar with precipitation: ~ 13 Mb 
    
Please, note that the estimate above depends on meteorological conditions and is for reference purposes only. 

## Can I have archived radar data?

Environment and Climate Change Canada does not have on online service to retrieve archived data.
The data retrieval service from our archive is under a cost recovery policy. We charge 99$/hour, with a minimum charge of 99$, to retrieve/recreate the requested data. The data itself is free.

It is available in either raw format (IRIS) or products in ASCII format. You will find more information about our formats and products at the addresses: 

http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/produits/samples/radar/vscan/Formats_used_in_URP_En_last_version.pdf

http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/CMOI/produits/samples/radar/vscan/Radar_Products_Available_CMC_Mai_2015_external.pdf

## Could I be made aware of any change to bulletins or model format and or content? 

For Canadian station bulletins, any change in the heading and station name is announced via what we call a GENOT (GEneral NOTification) message. 
We have a mailing list to distribute GENOTs for station and header changes. If you are interested in this e-mail notification, please send us your e-mail and we will add it to this mailing list. 

To be advised of major changes, such as model resolution, you can subscribe to the GENOT 03 mailing list.
You can find an example of a GENOT 03 bulletin here: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/doc/genots/2014/02/18/NOCN03_CWAO_182045___01117 

Finally, we strongly recommend to subscribe to the datamart's mailing list in order to be warned of any updates or changes regarding the data available. 
You can subscribe here:

http://lists.cmc.ec.gc.ca/mailman/listinfo/dd_info

Please use the following address to contact us for any comments or questions:
ec.dps-client.ec@canada.ca

## Could I have a GRIB data feed?

Environment and Climate Change Canada offers a push feed for its NWP data in GRIB format. This service is supported 24/7 and the cost is a function of the amount of data requested: at the starting price is $500/month + $500 set-up fee for up to 1 Gb/day. Add 500$/month for each additional Gb per day.

Please, contact us if you are interested in this service. 

## Why not make just one big GRIB file with all the variables?

Environment and Climate Change Canada opted to put one variable per file because we presumed that most users would not require all the variables. 
Moreover, would have we made packages with many variables, users would have made requests to have their choice of variables in the packages.

This is why we still believe that is the right strategy to disseminate GRIB data.

That being said, the web utility [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget) possesses features that aim to optimize the download process. For instance, users could write all the download file paths in one text file and use it as an argument to the command "wget -i list.txt". 
By proceeding like this, a single socket will be open and the request for all the listed files is treated as a single download, without opening and closing sockets for each file. 

This will then reach the same download speed as if all the GRIB files were in a single zip file.

## Can I have the current weather observation?

We have two XML products that contain the observations of the Environment and Climate Change Canada station network.

One is on a station basis, one file per station. All Canadian stations are included in this product. The documentation can be found here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/observations/doc/README_SWOB.txt

The other product is on a provincial/territorial basis. One file contains stations of only one province or territory. Not all the stations are included in this product. The documentation is here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/observations/doc/README_observations.txt

## Can I have access to weather warnings?

You can find information about Environment and Climate Change Canada's warning in several places.

Firstly, you can find documentation about our warnings here: 

http://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=D9553AB5-1 

You can access warnings through the RSS feed. See this page for more information:

http://weather.gc.ca/business/index_e.html#rss 

You can also find warnings in CAP-XML format on our open data server. Documentation of this service can be found here: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/alerts/doc/README_CAP.txt

ECCC also has an experimental service to send warnings or regions by email. See documentation on this service here:

https://ecalertme.weather.gc.ca/ 

Pelmorex Media Inc. also has a service for sending ECCC Warnings. You can find the information here:

https://alerts.pelmorex.com/ 

## Which are the main differences between RSS ATOM feeds and AMQP protocol to consume alerts?

The main difference between RSS feeds (ATOM) and AMQP is that in the case of the RSS feed, user needs to send a request to know if new files 
are available, whereas with AMQP, user is advised without sending any request.

If one wants to make an analogy, RSS feeds may be considering as a mailman who deposes letters in the mailbox, whereas AMQP may be considering as a deliver 
who rings at the door to give the postal package.

We recommend to use the AMQP protocol if it is important for users to receive the announcement and data once available, also AMQP is a longer-term solution.

## Can I have a shapefile of the warning regions?

You can find the shapefiles of the public forecast regions here (pick the latest version):

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/meteocode/geodata/

Please, note that there is no shapefile which includes all the possible regions for a given warning. Any warning can cover multiple regions and sub-regions, depending of the nature and extent of the warning. This is why the polygon is included in each of the CAP files, as described in the README file here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/alerts/doc/README_CAP.txt

## Can I have satellite images?

Environment and Climate Change Canada does not provide satellite images or products to external users, apart those from our web site (http://weather.gc.ca/satellite/index_e.html), as we are not the data producer. 
A recommended site for freely available satellite images is from the University of Washington: 

http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~ovens/loops/

If you require a data feed of satellite images, we suggest users contact our U.S. counterparts at NOAA or to seek a provider in the private sector. 

## Can I have access and use of icons displayed in the Citypage XML product? 

These icons are covered by the standard Environment Canada Terms and Conditions: https://www.canada.ca/en/transparency/terms.html
To make a commercial usage of these icons, you must obtain prior explicit consent.

You can download all ECCC weather icons from the following URL: http://meteo.gc.ca/weathericons/NN.gif

where NN is a number between 00 and 45.

You can also create your own icons using WMO World Weather Symbols. See <em>A complete set of WMO weather symbols in SVG with full metadata and fallback PNGs</em> at this address:

https://github.com/OGCMetOceanDWG/WorldWeatherSymbols 

## Can I have CSV minimum and maximum forecast temperature?

To obtain extreme forecast temperature data in CSV format, you can consult either:

- FMCN31 to FMCN38 forecast bulletins (CSV format), based on the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS). 
  0000 UTC forecasts contain the maximum of the current day, the minimum and maximum of day two and the minimum of day three. 
  1200 UTC forecasts contain the minima and maxima of day two and day three.

- FMCN41 to FMCN48 forecast bulletins (CSV format), based on the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS). . 
  1200 UTC forecasts contain the minimum and maximum of day two and the minimum of day three. 
  Forecasts based on 0000 UTC data contain the maximum of the current day and the minimum and maximum of day two.
    
These bulletins are available on the Datamart at this address: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/bulletins/alphanumeric/YYYYMMDD/FM/CWAO/ 

The documentation can be found here:

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/bulletins/doc/README_bulletins.txt

## Can I have rainfall amount data?

Regarding QPF (Quantitative Precipitation Forecast) data in CSV format, you may be interested in the FOCN03 bulletins, namely spot forecasts of meteorological variables obtained from direct RDPS (Regional Deterministic Prediction System) output . 
Each of these bulletins are produced specifically for individual Canadian forecast sites. The content is therefore variable. For example, values of forecast parameters are available at 6-hour intervals from 0 to 48 hours for some bulletins, and at 6-hour intervals from 0 to 24 hours and 12-hour intervals from 24 to 48 hours for some others. 
Forecast weather elements may also differ from message to message.

These bulletins are available on the Datamart at this address: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/bulletins/focn03/YYYYMMDD/FO/ 
    
You can find documentation about alphanumeric bulletins on the Datamart at the adress: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/bulletins/doc/README_bulletins.txt, 

A bulletin search interface for the Meteorological Service of Canada http data server is available at: 

http://dd.weather.gc.ca/cgi-bin/bulletin_search.pl , 
and the associated documentation can be found here: 

http://dd.meteo.gc.ca/bulletins/doc/CMC_Bulletin_Search_Help_en.pdf
    
Finally, one could mention our geospatial services, and more specifically the GeoMet-Beta services. See: http://lists.ec.gc.ca/pipermail/geomet-info/2016-July/000034.html. 
You can find RDPA-CaPA layers and in a near future you will be able to download directly CSV or other formats of data directly through the GRIB files. 
If you wish to be advise of any update, we recommend you to subscribe to the mailing list through : 

http://lists.ec.gc.ca/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/geomet-info 

## What is the datum of model X?

You can use the free [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) tool to retrieve datum and projection information for our GRIB2 files. 
The following command will provide the datum and projection of the file:

gdalinfo file.grib2

In the output, information starts with "Coordinate System is:".

## Can I have the topography of model X?

The model topography is the field HGT_SFC (Model topography - Smoothed) of the prognostic hour 00.

## Can I have the land sea mask of model X?

You can use the variable LAND_SFC_0 (Land cover) of prognostic hour 00 to determine this mask. 
Where the value is 0, it is sea, where the value is not 0, it is land (or portion of it).

## I do not see a condition under the corresponding element of the Citypage XML file

Some weather stations are automatic (unmanned) and do not report the current condition. 
If you look to the corresponding page on our web site, for example Edmonton, you will see that it is written <em>Not observed</em> for the condition, see:

http://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/ab-50_metric_e.html

This is why there is no icon or condition reported in the corresponding Citypage XML file.

## Why are message queues terminated after several hours of inactivity when using AMQP?

Users are expected to run a daemon that downloads data constantly, such as the one provided by Sarracenia (http://metpx.sf.net). In AMQP parlance, a pump, namely a host running Sarracenia, 
is a broker (see Glossaty section at the address: http://metpx.sourceforge.net/Install.html).   
The broker has a limited ability to queue products when a user has an unintended lengthy outage, say anywhere from a few hours to a few days. The performance of the entire service is adversely affected by the presence of large queues for any single consumer, 
so queues cannot be allowed to accumulate indefinitely.  
We keep queues alive as long as we can reasonably do so, but this practice is only meant to give clients time to restart their session in case of failure. The duration of disconnects that can be safely withstood depends on the number of products subscribed which in turn determines how many products get queued. 
Generally when there is a queue of more than 25,000 products, and no consumer, the queue will be purged.   

In General, one should use continuous access, rather than periodic polling, as it will remove peaks in download bandwidth and server load, and reduce the risk of queues being purged on the server. 
Judicious use of the 'subtopic' directive in configurations will minimize the size of queues, so they can last through longer outages.
